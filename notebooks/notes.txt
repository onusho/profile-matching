    clustering

fake profiles -> web scraping
    short bios
    interests, beliefs (politics, religion)

data preparation
    scaling data
    vectorizing bios
        count, tfidf
    pca
        74 features account for 95% variability
        117 -> 74 features
    
    clustering
        silhouette coefficient
            intra-cluster distance (a), mean nearest-cluster distance (b)
            (b - a) / max(a, b)
        davies bouldin score
            average similarity measure of each cluster with its most similar cluster


    correlation to find the most simillar profiles

new data
    clustering again
        Limiting the user inputâ€™s vocabulary
        Create multiple datasets with limited amounts of data
        Find a faster computer to process the data
        Only vectorize words seen before and neglect potentially new words 
    classification modeling
            dummy baseline
            knn
            svm
        macro average (cuz of class imbalance) F1 score (balance between precision, recall)

data set creation problems
    validation function wasn't working properly therby creating an infinite loop where it was prompting again and again
